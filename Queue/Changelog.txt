- None

Changes in 9.4.1:

- Fixed issue where CloudQueue metadata was cleared after various calls which didn't return metadata payload.
- Obsoleted CloudQueueMessage.SetMessageContent, replaced with SetMessageContent2 to resolve long-standing inconsistency between platforms.
- Added more ctors to CloudQueueMessage.
- Added support for passing in a DelegatingHandler to use for HTTP calls.  A chain of DelegatingHandler instances is supported, but the innermost handler must have a null InnerHandler, which will be assigned our own HttpClientHandler instance for authentication purposes.  The DelegatingHandler can modify properties on the HttpClientHandler, such as Proxy.  This instance will be unique to the client in that case.  Not passing in a DelegatingHandler will continue to use a singleton HttpClientHandler.

Changes in 9.4.0:

- Feature parity with the 9.3.2 release of the non-split library.
- Removed support for PCL and NetStandard 1.0.
- Moving back to using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage instead of Microsoft.Azure.Storage.  This is a temporary change to ease the transition for existing libraries.  The namespace will change back at a future time.

Changes in 9.4.0-preview:

- WinRT/WinPhoneRT: Removed support for Windows8.1 and WindowsPhone 8.1 in favor of UWP support through Netstandard2.0.
- Added NetStandard2.0 target support.
- Desktop: Transitioned from HttpWebRequest to HttpClient in all the protocol layer APIs and classes. 
- NetStandard2.0: Added support for synchronous methods. Please note that the synchrounous APIs are wrappers over the asynchronous APIs (sync-over-async) due to transition to HttpClient which does not offer a true sync functionality.
- All: Removed the un-necessary stream wrapping when progress tracking is not requested.

Changes in 9.0.0-preview:
- All: Support for 2017-07-29 REST version. Please see our REST API documentation and blogs for information about the related added features. If you are using the Storage Emulator, please update to Emulator version 5.3.
- Queues: Added support for infinite TTL on queue messages.
- All:  When a storage request fails, the error code may now be retrieved directly from the RequestResult and StorageException classes. This error code is populated even in cases where there is no ExtendedErrorInformation available, such as in calls to FetchAttributes.
- All: Upgarded NewtonSoft.json dependency to 10.0.2.
- All: Upgraded Netstandard dependency to 1.6.1.
- All (RT/NetCore): Improved performance by avoiding Task.Run
