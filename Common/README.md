# Microsoft Azure Storage Common SDK for .NET (9.4.1)

The Microsoft Azure Storage Common SDK for .NET is referenced by Azure Storage Blob/Queue/File SDKs and Azure CosmosDB Table SDK
and should not be referenced directly by your application.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes. 

## Target Frameworks

- .NET Framework 4.5.2: As of December 2016, Storage Client Libraries for .NET supports primarily the desktop .NET Framework 4.5.2 release and above.
- Netstandard1.3: Storage Client Libraries for .NET are available to support Netstandard application development including Xamarin/UWP applications. 
- Netstandard2.0: Storage Client Libraries for .NET are available to support Netstandard2.0 application development including Xamarin/UWP applications. 

## Versioning Information

- The Storage Client Libraries use [the semantic versioning scheme.](http://semver.org/)


## Use with the Azure Storage Emulator

- The Client Library uses a particular Storage Service version. In order to use the Storage Client Library with the Storage Emulator, a corresponding minimum version of the Azure Storage Emulator must be used. Older versions of the Storage Emulator do not have the necessary code to successfully respond to new requests.
- Currently, the minimum version of the Azure Storage Emulator needed for this library is 5.4. If you encounter a `VersionNotSupportedByEmulator` (400 Bad Request) error, please [update the Storage Emulator.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)

## Download & Install

The Storage Client Library ships with the Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET and also on NuGet. 
You'll find the latest version and hotfixes on NuGet via the `Azure.Storage.Common` package.  

This version of the Storage Client Library ships with the storage version 2018-03-28.
