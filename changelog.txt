  - All: CompletedSynchronously property returns inconsistent values on IAsyncResult objects returned by asynchronous methods and thus TaskFactory.FromAsync does not work properly.
  - Tables: Public DynamicTableEntity constructors use DateTime even though the Timestamp property is of type DateTimeOffset.
  - Tables: BeginSaveChangesWithRetries overload ignores the options argument.
  
Issues fixed in 2.0.1 : 
	
  - All: CloudStorageAccount.*Parse methods throw an exception for "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" string.
  - All: StorageErrorCodeStrings class is missing.
  - Blobs: ICloudBlob interface does not have GetSharedAccessSignature method.
