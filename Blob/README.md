# Microsoft Azure Storage Blob SDK for .NET (9.0.0-preview)

The Microsoft Azure Storage Blob SDK for .NET allows you to build Azure applications that take advantage of scalable cloud computing resources.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes. 

## Features

- Blobs
    - Create/Read/Update/Delete Blobs

## Getting Started

The complete Microsoft Azure SDK can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Azure Downloads Page](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/?sdk=net) and ships with support for building deployment packages, integrating with tooling, rich command line tooling, and more.

Please review [Get started with Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs) if you are not familiar with Azure Storage.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes. 

## Target Frameworks

- .NET Framework 4.5: As of December 2016, Storage Client Libraries for .NET supports primarily the desktop .NET Framework 4.5.0 release and above.
- Windows 8.1 for Windows Store app development: Storage Client Libraries are available for Windows Store applications.
- Windows Phone 8.1 app development: Storage Client Libraries are available for Windows Phone applications including Universal applications.
- Netstandard1.3: Storage Client Libraries for .NET are available to support Netstandard application development including Xamarin/UWP applications. 
- Netstandard1.0: Storage Client Libraries support PCL through a Netstandard Façade targeting netstandard1.0.

### Netstandard1.0 (Façade)

As the lowest TFM supported by all our implementations, 1.0 is selected to provide support for maximum platforms. The support is provided through a façade reference assembly targeting netstandard1.0. This assembly consists of a common set of APIs between Win8 and Wpa with no API implementations.
Through the bait and switch technique, the reference assembly enables other portable class libraries to reference Storage Client Library, while the correct implementation assembly will be picked when the package is referenced by the project.json file.


## Versioning Information

- The Storage Client Libraries use [the semantic versioning scheme.](http://semver.org/)

## Use with the Azure Storage Emulator

- The Client Library uses a particular Storage Service version. In order to use the Storage Client Library with the Storage Emulator, a corresponding minimum version of the Azure Storage Emulator must be used. Older versions of the Storage Emulator do not have the necessary code to successfully respond to new requests.
- Currently, the minimum version of the Azure Storage Emulator needed for this library is 5.3. If you encounter a `VersionNotSupportedByEmulator` (400 Bad Request) error, please [update the Storage Emulator.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)

## Download & Install

The Storage Client Library ships with the Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET and also on NuGet. 
You'll find the latest version and hotfixes on NuGet via the `Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob` package.  

This version of the Storage Client Library ships with the storage version 2017-07-29.

### Via Git

To get the source code of the SDK via git just type:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net.git
cd azure-storage-net
```

### Via NuGet

To get the binaries of this library as distributed by Microsoft, ready for use
within your project you can also have them installed by the .NET package manager [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob/).

Please note that the minimum nuget client version requirement has been updated to 2.12 in order to support multiple netstandard targets in the nuget package.

`Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob`

## Dependencies

### Newtonsoft Json

The desktop and phone libraries depend on Newtonsoft Json, which can be downloaded directly or referenced by your code project through Nuget.

- [Newtonsoft.Json] (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json)

### Key Vault

The client-side encryption support depends on the KeyVault.Core package, which can be downloaded directly or referenced by your code project through Nuget.

- [KeyVault.Core] (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Core)

Tests for the client-side encryption support also depend on KeyVault.Extensions, which can be downloaded directly or referenced by your code project through Nuget.

- [KeyVault.Extensions] (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Extensions)
